## ‚ú® Why VisionVox Stands Out

### üß† Cognitive Features
- **Intelligent Scene Interpretation** - Goes beyond basic object detection to understand context, emotions, and relationships
- **Conversational Captions** - Generates human-like descriptions with personality and flair
- **Multilingual Narration** - Speaks your captions in 30+ languages with natural inflection
- **Memory Recall** - Maintains a searchable history of all your visual interactions

### üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise-Grade Security
- **Military-Grade Encryption** for user credentials (bcrypt + PBKDF2)
- **Privacy First** - No cloud processing unless you opt-in
- **Session Protection** - Automatic logout with activity monitoring

### üé® Designed for Humans
- **Dark/Light Mode** - Eye-friendly interface with automatic system adaptation
- **Voice Control** - "Hey Vision, describe this picture!"
- **One-Click Export** - Save captions as text, audio, or share directly to social media
